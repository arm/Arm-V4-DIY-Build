# Arm-V4-DIY-Build

- All .stl files are included in this repository
- 3D print all of the files
- then use RobotArmFullAssembled.stl and RobotArmAssembledPicture as reference to build
- everything else is bolted together with holes sizes in the stl files
- standard servos and extensions are used
- servos connected to arduino and external power supply
- led lights were glued to back for indication
- two thick wires were used to attach base springs through 3D printed holes
